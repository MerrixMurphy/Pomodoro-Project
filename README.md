# Pomodoro-Project
A timer project for the Thinkful program that is based on the tomatoe timers found in kitchens. This includes the ability to set a work duration between 5 and 60 minutes, as well as the ability to set the break duration between 1 and 15 minutes. After setting the time, a timer will appear for the work duration selected. After the time is up, a sound will play and the timer will switch to the break duration. Once that is done, the timer will repeat the process until the user stops.

This was a project for the thinkful program and is considered complete. There are no future plans for this yet.
